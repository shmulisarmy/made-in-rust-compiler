Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] add methods  
- [ ] define proper block bodys and dont allow while, if and expressions in the global scope  
- [ ] do basic type checking and checking for valid vars, where you first check on items in the local scope (its only valid if defined already when you get up to useage). however if its defined later in the global scope then its valid (order matters in the local scope and not in the global scope)
