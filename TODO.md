### In Progress


### Done âœ“

- [x] support a directory full of files  
- [x] do basic type checking and checking for valid vars, where you first check on items in the local scope (its only valid if defined already when you get up to usage). however if its defined later in the global scope then its valid (order matters in the local scope and not in the global scope)  
- [x] define proper block body's and don't allow while, if and expressions in the global scope  
- [x] need to make sure to have better panics for not having expected token type instead return a token with a size of 0  
- [x] add methods
